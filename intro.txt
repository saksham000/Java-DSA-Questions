Hello, my name is Saksham Sharma, and I’m currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Chandigarh University. I’m a dedicated full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend technologies, particularly in Java and Spring Boot. Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in building and deploying applications using tools like AWS, Jenkins, and Docker, along with frontend technologies like React.js and SCSS.

One of my key projects is a School Management & Live Teaching System, where I developed a comprehensive platform with secure, real-time meeting features using Spring Boot and React. I have my work on an open-source project, Feedback Hub, where I optimized APIs and integrated Swagger for enhanced performance and documentation. Additionally, my freelance project for a travel agency allowed me to lead end-to-end development and deployment, resulting in positive client feedback.

Beyond technical work, I’ve participated in hackathons, like the Kavach Cybersecurity Hackathon, where I demonstrated my problem-solving skills in a high-stakes environment, ultimately placing as the 2nd runner-up. My goal is to apply my technical skills and adaptability to contribute effectively to a forward-thinking team, and I’m excited to bring my skills to IBM.
